For 2002 Ercot is split into 4 zones with TCRs between 3 of the zones. The zones are fairly diverse from a supply/demand perspective. Ercot has an average load of 38,000 MW, a peak of 57,000 MW with a breakdown of 30% industrial, 30% commercial and 40% residential.

Our intent is to secure one of these within the next 2 months.\n', '\n', 'I have included some price history to show the hourly volatility and a business plan to show the scope of the opportunity.

This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.

We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.

For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.\n"", '\n', 'Following are the highlights of our businesses:\n', '\n', 'Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.

Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).\n', 'Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.\n', '\n', 'Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.\n', '\n', '\n', 'Transportation and Distribution:\n', '\tNatural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.\n', 'Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.\n', 'Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.\n', '\n', ""Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.

This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.\n', '\n', 'In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:\n', '?\tA $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.\n', '?\t$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.

Shay asked, ""Do you think they will let me play?""  Shay\'s\n', '> father knew that most boys would not want him on their team. But the father\n', '> understood that if his son were allowed to play it would give him a\n', ""> much-needed sense of belonging.  Shay's father approached one of the boys on\n"", '> the field and asked if Shay could play.  The boy looked around for guidance\n', '> from his teammates.\n', '>\n', '> Getting none, he took matters into his own hands and said, ""We are losing by\n', '> six runs, and the game is in the eighth inning.  I guess he can be on our\n', '> team and we\'ll try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning.""\n', '>\n', ""> In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was\n"", '> still behind by three.

Although no hits came his way, he was obviously\n', '> ecstatic just to be on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his father\n', '> waved to him from the stands.\n', '>\n', ""> In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, with two\n"", '> outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base.  Shay was\n', '> scheduled to be the next at-bat. Would the team actually let Shay bat at\n', '> this juncture and give away their chance to win the game?\n', '>\n', '> Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat.\n', '>\n', ""> Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even\n"", '> know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.\n', '> However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher moved a few steps to\n', '> lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact. The\n', '> first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed.\n', '>\n', '> The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly toward\n', '> Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground\n', '> ball to the pitcher.\n', '>\n', '> The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown the\n', '> ball to the first baseman.  Shay would have been out and that would have\n', '> ended the game.  Instead, the pitcher took the ball and threw it on a high\n', '> arc to right field, far beyond reach of the first baseman.\n', '>\n', '> Everyone started yelling, ""Shay, run to first. Run to first."" Never in his\n', '> life had Shay ever made it to first base.  He scampered down the baseline,\n', '> wide-eyed and startled.  Everyone yelled ""Run to second, run to second!""  By\n', '> the time Shay was rounding first base, the right fielder had the ball.  He\n', '> could have thrown the ball to the second baseman for a tag.  But the right\n', ""> fielder understood what the pitcher's intentions had been, so he threw the\n"", ""> ball high and far over the third baseman's head.  Shay ran towards second\n"", '> base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases towards home.\n', '>\n', '> As Shay reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran to him, turned him\n', '> in the direction of third base, and shouted, ""Run to third!""  As Shay\n', '> rounded third, the boys from both teams were screaming, ""Shay! Run home!""\n', '>\n', '> Shay ran home, stepped on home plate and was cheered as the hero, for\n', '> hitting a ""grand slam"" and winning the game for his team.\n', '>\n', '> ""That day,"" said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face,""the\n', '> boys from both teams helped bring a piece of the Divine Plan into this\n', '> world.""\n', '>\n', '> And now, a footnote to the story.

The PUC has\n', 'threatened this several times and has deferred action several times pending\n', 'action on the issue by the legislature.  Even if the PUC were to act, the\n', 'legislature could override their action with a statute.  But I anticipate\n', 'that they will not act as long as the legislature is actively considering\n', 'the matter and does something before recessing for the year on September\n', '14th.\n', 'The real action is in the legislature.  There is a comprehensive bill -- SB\n', '78XX, the centerpiece of which is a bailout of Southern California Edison.\n', 'For DA or anyhting else in the energy arena to happen, the Governor and the\n', 'Assembly Democratic leadership insist on having a bailout of Edison.  Here\n', 'are the details of the bailout and DA which is linked to it:\n', '\n', '1) The state would securitize $2.9 billion in bonds to help SCE pay its\n', 'debts.  Those bonds would be repaid by Edison customers who use 20kW or\n', 'more in peak daily demand.  That would translate to about 0.06 (as in\n', '6/100ths) of a penny per kW.  The original proposal was to place the\n', 'bailout burden only on SCE customers who use 500kW peak demand, which would\n', 'have been maybe 1.5 cents per kW (since the base would have been much\n', 'smaller), but  we beat that back to the current proposal of 20kW.\n', '\n', '2) The Edison surcharge would be non-bypassable.  That means that Edison\n', 'customers are going to pay it whether you get your juice through Edison or\n', 'from a DA contractor.  If anyone is telling you that you can avoid the\n', 'Edison bailout surchage by going DA they are lying!\n', '\n', '3) The bill would permit DA going forward if there is demand (load) which\n', 'exceeds supply as calculated as follows: DWR contracts + IOU retained\n', 'generation + IOU long term contracts.  If this delta, or headroom exists as\n', 'of 1/1/03, then, per PUC regs,which are yet to be devloped, the Calif.\n', 'Energy Commission would periodically permit DA contracts up to the amount\n', 'of headroom, without the customer having to pay the state an exit fee.  (An\n', 'exit fee is a fee which would otherwise have to be paid to the state by a\n', ""customer for the customer's proportional share of the state's stranded\n"", 'costs which accrue from power contracts bought by DWR, but for which there\n', 'is no market.)  If no headroom exists, a customer still could go DA, but\n', 'pay the exit fee to do so.\n', '\n', '4) A major issue is what DA would be permitted and what would be suspended.\n', 'Right now the proposal is to permit all DA contracts that existed prior to\n', '1/17/01 to continue without penalty.  It looks like contracts signed\n', 'between January and June would also be permitted to remain without penalty,\n', 'but that date is not definite.  Contracts signed between June and August\n', '24th would also be permitted, but may have to pay some sort of retroactive\n', 'exit fee, on a sliding scale, depending on the date they were signed.  All\n', 'DA contracts after August 24th would be subject to the 1/1/03 schedule\n', 'described in #3 above.\n', '\n', 'In addition to an Edison surcharge for Edison customers, and exit fees for\n', 'DA customers when no headroom exists, there will be another surcharge for\n', 'all non-municipal customers who have bought power through an IUO since\n', 'January 17th.  That surcharge would be to payoff $13 billiion in state\n', 'revenue bonds which would be to repay the state General Fund for power DWR\n', 'bought since January.\n', '\n', 'Where does BOMA, and the rest of the business community stand on these\n', 'issues?\n', '\n', '1) BOMA has been O.K. with the bond surcharge because every IOU electric\n', 'customer has been paying subsidized rates for electricity since Jan. 17,\n', 'when the IOUs became uncreditworthy and DWR started buying spot market\n', 'power.\n', '\n', '2) While BOMA and others are not happy with the price and amount of DWR\n', 'long term contracts, we understand the state is CURRENTLY on the hook for\n', 'them, and wants to be held harmless for their costs.  BOMA and other\n', 'business groups are pushing to have as many of those contracts renegotiated\n', 'or abandoned where possible to make more headroom available for DA without\n', 'exit fees.\n', '\n', '3) BOMA supports another provision of the bill which would rebate any\n', 'surplus electricity revenues after the first $500 million to ratepayers\n', 'based on each customers proportional share of consumption and electric rate\n', 'payments.  This provision is designed to soften the rate increases on\n', 'customers who have experienced rate increases greater than 50% in the last\n', 'few months.\n', '\n', '4) Finally, BOMA is not happy with a ratepayer bailout of Edison.  But the\n', 'Governor seems to want it more than breath and he is strong arming everyone\n', 'he can see, including all business groups, to help get it enacted.  In that\n', 'light, BOMA supported a position that all ratepayers, residential as well\n', 'as business pay the debt.  The legislature, however, did not want to pass\n', 'this cost on to residential customers, so then it became a fight over where\n', 'the consumer threshold would be.  As stated above, we have suceeded in\n', 'getting it as low as 20kW peak demand.  (NOTE:  There are those that feel\n', 'it is worth bailing Edison out and getting them creditworthy in order to\n', 'get the state out of the energy business.  You can decide for yourselves.)\n', '\n', '5) It should also be noted that the Edison, bond and DWR surcharges may all\n', 'be covered in the existing rates you are now paying.  That is to say that\n', 'there may be no need to raise rates again to meet these obligations since\n', 'the market price for power has come down substantially.  But this remains\n', 'to be seen.\n', '\n', 'There is more to this package and moer to come i9n terms of changes.

Early in 2001 the company\n', 'requested the U.S. National Regulatory Commission to start laying the\n', 'groundwork for PBMR licensing.\n', '\t   Exelon would like to see the $300 million demonstration unit,\n', 'which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model, to show\n', 'that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety,\n', 'efficiency and viability are proven enough for U.S. regulatory\n', 'agencies to proceed forward with licensing.

If approved,\n', 'Exelon may then start concurrent construction of U.S. sites to bring\n', 'PBMR-generated power to market at the earliest possible date and at\n', 'the best price. Specifications and claims by Eskom, who purchased the\n', 'technology after a 21-year development and proving period in Germany,\n', 'present the PBMR as small, safe, clean, cost efficient, inexpensive\n', 'and adaptable.\n', '\t   The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in\n', 'graphite to form a fuel sphere (60mm in diameter).
